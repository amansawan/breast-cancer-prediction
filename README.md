# Cancer Prediction - Machine Learning Model

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts whether a tumor is malignant or benign using patient data. This is a classic binary classification problem often associated with breast cancer datasets. The project demonstrates a complete pipeline from data processing to model evaluation.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

* `Cancer Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing data analysis, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and final predictions.
* `README.md`: Project overview and setup instructions.

## ðŸ§  Features of the Project

* Loading and understanding cancer dataset
* Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
* Feature Scaling and Transformation
* Model Selection and Training (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)
* Model Evaluation (accuracy, ROC curve, classification report)
* Final Prediction Pipeline

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amansawan/breast-cancer-prediction.git
cd cancer-prediction
```

### 2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook "Cancer Prediction.ipynb"
```

## ðŸ”§ Dependencies

* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `scikit-learn`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`
* `jupyter`

## ðŸ“Š Sample Output

* Accuracy: \~XX% (update after training)
* ROC Curve
* Confusion Matrix
* Classification Report
